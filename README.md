# CPBDS
The Cross-Pollination Bird-Dogging System (CPBDS) helps keep track of flowers you are cross pollinating.

CPBDS uses JavaFX for the GUI and Sqlite as the database.  CPBDS is meant for a single user.

## Setup & Running Instructions
You will be required to use the javafx-sdk-xx library and sqlite-jdbc library to run this on your local machine.  Once these libraries are setup, you can simply run the CpbdsGui.java file and everything should work.
